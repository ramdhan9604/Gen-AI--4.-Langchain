ChromaSocks: This name combines the words \"chroma,\" which refers to the colorfulness of an object, and \"socks\" to create a name that highlights the colorful nature of your products.\n3. VibrantSoles: This name uses the word \"vibrant\" to describe the bright, lively colors of your socks and \"soles\" to refer to the part of the sock that comes into contact with the ground.\n4. Kaleidosock: This name combines the word \"kaleidoscope,\" which brings to mind a constantly changing, colorful pattern, with \"sock\" to create a name that evokes the fun, playful nature of your socks.\n5.

This can be things like: Google Search, Database lookup, Python REPL, other chains.\n    - LLM: The language model powering the agent.\n    - Agent: The agent to use.\n\n      Agent is a very powerful concept in LangChain\n\n</span>\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<span style=\"color: red; font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold;\">\nFor example I have to travel from Dubai to Canada, I type this in ChatGPT\n\n    ---> Give me  two flight options from Dubai to Canada on September 1, 2024 | ChatGPT will not be able to answer because has knowledge till\n    September 2021\n\n    ChatGPT plus has Expedia Plugin, if we enable this plugin it will go to Expedia Plugin and will try to pull information about Flights & it will show the information\n</span>\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n<span style=\"color: red; font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold;\">\nSerpApi is a real-time API to access Google search results.\n</span>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<span style=\"color: red; font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; background-color: yellow;\">\nWikipedia and ll-math tool\n</span>\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install wikipedia","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-03-03T07:02:55.503844Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-03-03T07:02:55.504137Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-03-03T07:03:00.803383Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-03-03T07:02:55.504115Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-03-03T07:03:00.802414Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Collecting wikipedia\n  Downloading wikipedia-1.4.0.tar.gz (27 kB)\n  Preparing metadata (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\nRequirement already satisfied: beautifulsoup4 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from wikipedia) (4.12.3)\nRequirement already satisfied: requests<3.0.0,>=2.0.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from wikipedia) (2.32.3)\nRequirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<4,>=2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests<3.0.0,>=2.0.0->wikipedia) (3.4.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests<3.0.0,>=2.0.0->wikipedia) (3.10)\nRequirement already satisfied: urllib3<3,>=1.21.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests<3.0.0,>=2.0.0->wikipedia) (2.3.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests<3.0.0,>=2.0.0->wikipedia) (2025.1.31)\nRequirement already satisfied: soupsieve>1.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from beautifulsoup4->wikipedia) (2.6)\nBuilding wheels for collected packages: wikipedia\n  Building wheel for wikipedia (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n  Created wheel for wikipedia: filename=wikipedia-1.4.0-py3-none-any.whl size=11679 sha256=61ac2ac19e339b44395bef127cdfa1a7536ebd7b4999be0e7a159a4613c148e1\n  Stored in directory: /root/.cache/pip/wheels/5e/b6/c5/93f3dec388ae76edc830cb42901bb0232504dfc0df02fc50de\nSuccessfully built wikipedia\nInstalling collected packages: wikipedia\nSuccessfully installed wikipedia-1.4.0\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":73},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent, load_tools\nfrom langchain_groq import ChatGroq\n\n# Initialize the LLM (Language Model)\nllm = ChatGroq(model_name=\"llama-3.3-70b-versatile\")\n\n# Load the tools (Wikipedia and LLM Math)\ntools = load_tools([\"wikipedia\", \"llm-math\"], llm=llm)\n\n# Initialize the agent with the tools, LLM, and agent type\nagent = initialize_agent(\n    tools,\n    llm,\n    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,\n    verbose=True  # Set to True to see the agent's thought process\n)\n\n# Test the agent by asking a question\nresponse = agent.run(\"What was the GDP of US in 2024?\")\nprint(response)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-03-03T07:49:54.221779Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-03-03T07:49:54.222109Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-03-03T07:50:00.539832Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-03-03T07:49:54.222085Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-03-03T07:50:00.539005Z"},"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"<ipython-input-83-1a69337a47c5>:11: LangChainDeprecationWarning: LangChain agents will continue to be supported, but it is recommended for new use cases to be built with LangGraph.

It is the world's largest economy by nominal GDP and second largest by purchasing power parity (PPP). As of 2024, it has the world's sixth highest nominal GDP per capita and eighth highest GDP per capita by PPP). The U.S. accounted for 26% of the global economy in 2023 in nominal terms, and about 15.5% in PPP terms. The U.S. dollar is the currency of record most used in international transactions and is the world's reserve currency, backed by a large U.S. treasuries market, its role as the reference standard for the petrodollar system, and its linked eurodollar. Several countries use it as their official currency and in others it is the de facto currency. Since the end of World War II, the economy has achieved relatively steady growth, low unemployment and inflation, and rapid advances in technology.\nThe American economy is fueled by high productivity, well developed transportation infrastructure, and extensive natural resources. Americans have the sixth highest average household and employee income among OECD member states. In 2021, they had the highest median household income among OECD countries although the country also had one of the world's highest income inequalities among the developed countries. The largest U.S. trading partners are Canada, Mexico, China, Japan, Germany, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Taiwan, India, and Vietnam. The U.S. is the world's largest importer and second largest exporter. It has free trade agreements with several countries, including Canada and Mexico (through the USMCA), Australia, South Korea, Israel, and several others that are in effect or under negotiation. The U.S. has a highly flexible labor market, where the industry adheres to a hire-and-fire policy, and job security is relatively low. Among OECD nations, the U.S. has a highly efficient and strong social security system; social expenditure stood at roughly 30% of GDP. \nThe United States is the world's largest producer of petroleum and natural gas. In 2016, it was the world's largest trading country and second largest manufacturer, with American manufacturing making up a fifth of the global total. The U.S. not only has the largest internal market for goods, but also dominates the services trade. Total U.S. trade was $4.2 trillion in 2018. Of the world's 500 largest companies, 139 are headquartered in the U.S. The U.S. has the world's highest number of billionaires, with total wealth of $5.7 trillion. U.S. commercial banks had $22.9 trillion in assets in December 2022. U.S. global assets under management had more than $30 trillion in assets. During the Great Recession of 2008, the U.S. economy suffered a significant decline. The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act was enacted by the United States Congress, and in the ensuing years the U.S. experienced the longest economic expansion on record by July 2019.\nThe New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq are the world's largest stock exchanges by market capitalization and trade volume. The U.S. has the world's largest gold reserve, with over 8,000 tonnes of gold. In 2014, the U.S. economy was ranked first in international ranking on venture capital and global research and development funding. The U.S. spends around 3.46% of GDP on cutting-edge research and development across various sectors of the economy. The U.S. has produced the world's highest number of Nobel laureates in the economics field. It is also the world's fourth largest high-technology exporter. Consumer spending comprised 68% of the U.S. economy in 2022, while its labor share of income was 44% in 2021. The U.S. has the world's largest consumer market. The nation's labor market has attracted immigrants from all over the world and its net migration rate is among the highest in the world. The U.S. is one of the top-performing economies in studies such as the Ease of Doing Business Index, the Global Competitiveness Report, and other\u001b[0m\nThought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThought: The Wikipedia page provides general information about the US economy, but it does not provide the specific GDP data for 2024. However, it does mention that the US has the world's largest economy by nominal GDP, and it provides some data on the US economy in previous years.\n\nAction: wikipedia\nAction Input: United States GDP 2024\u001b[0m\nObservation: \u001b[36;1m\u001b[1;3mPage: List of U.S. states and territories by GDP\nSummary: This is a list of U.S. states and territories by gross domestic product (GDP). This article presents the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia and their nominal GDP at current prices.\nThe data source for the list is the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) in 2024. The BEA defined GDP by state as \"the sum of value added from all industries in the state.\"\nOverall, in the calendar year 2024, the United States' Nominal GDP at Current Prices totaled at $29.017 trillion, as compared to $25.744 trillion in 2022.\nThe three U.S. states with the highest GDPs were California ($4.080 trillion), Texas ($2.695 trillion), and New York ($2.284 trillion). The three U.S. states with the lowest GDPs were Vermont ($45.4 billion), Wyoming ($53.0 billion), and Alaska ($69.8 billion).\nGDP per capita also varied widely throughout the United States in 2024, with New York ($117,332), Massachusetts ($110,561), and Washington (state) ($108,468) recording the three highest GDP per capita figures in the U.S., while Mississippi ($53,061), Arkansas ($60,276), and West Virginia ($60,783) recorded the three lowest GDP per capita figures in the U.S. The District of Columbia, though, recorded a GDP per capita figure far higher than any U.S. state in 2024 at $263,220.\n\n\n\nPage: 2024 United States presidential election\nSummary: Presidential elections were held in the United States on November 5, 2024. The Republican Party's ticket—Donald Trump, who was the 45th president of the United States from 2017 to 2021, and JD Vance, the junior U.S. senator from Ohio—defeated the Democratic Party's ticket—Kamala Harris, the incumbent vice president, and Tim Walz, the 41st governor of Minnesota.\nThe incumbent president, Joe Biden of the Democratic Party, initially ran for re-election as the party's presumptive nominee, facing little opposition and easily defeating Representative Dean Phillips of Minnesota during the Democratic primaries; however, what was broadly considered a poor debate performance in June 2024 intensified concerns about his age and health, and led to calls within his party for him to leave the race. After initially declining to do so, Biden withdrew on July 21, becoming the first eligible incumbent president to withdraw since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968. Biden endorsed Harris, who was voted the party's nominee by the delegates on August 5, 2024, became the first nominee who did not participate in the primaries since Hubert Humphrey, also in 1968. Harris selected Walz as her running mate. This was the first time since 2000 in which an incumbent vice president ran for president.\nTrump, who lost in 2020 to Biden, ran for re-election again. He was nominated during the 2024 Republican National Convention along with his running mate, Vance, after winning the Republican primaries by easily defeating former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley. The Trump campaign made many false and misleading statements, including the claim that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump. Trump engaged in anti-immigrant fearmongering and promoted conspiracy theories. His political movement was described by historians and former Trump administration officials as authoritarian, featuring parallels to fascism, and using dehumanizing rhetoric toward his political opponents.\nTrump won the Electoral College with 312 electoral votes, while Harris received 226. Trump won every swing state, including the first win of Nevada by Republicans since 2004, in addition to holding on to all of the states that he won in 2020. Trump won the national popular vote with a plurality of 49.8%, making him the first Republican to do so since George W. Bush in 2004. Relative to the 2020 election, he improved his vote share among working class voters, particularly among young men, those without college degrees, and Hispanic voters. This election marked the first time since 1888 that three consecutive presidential elections were decided by fewer than 100\u001b[0m\nThought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThought: The Wikipedia page provides the GDP data for the United States in 2024, which is $29.017 trillion.\n\nAction: None\nThought: I now know the final answer\nFinal Answer: The GDP of the US in 2024 was $29.017 trillion.\u001b[0m\n\n\u001b[1m> Finished chain.\u001b[0m\nThe GDP of the US in 2024 was $29.017 trillion.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":83},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<span style=\"color: red; font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; background-color: yellow;\">\n7.

Abstract: \\n \\nMachine learning is like a super-smart computer program that learns from Medical Data. Machine learning \\nis changing the field of Medical Sector. Machine Learning algorithms are empowering medical \\nprofessionals, accelerating research and ultimately improving patient outcomes.  By analyzing medical \\nrecords, Machine learning helps doctors diagnose diseases earlier and predict health risks. One exiting \\narea is diabetes prediction. Machine Learning can analyze your blood sugar, weight and family history to \\nsee how likely you are to develop diabetes. This allows for early intervention, like lifestyle changes to \\nprevent the disease altogether. \\n \\n2. Problem Statement: \\n \\nDiabetes is a chronic condition affecting millions globally, often going undetected until com plications \\narise. Early detection is crucial for effective management and preventing serious health issues. Traditional \\nmethods rely on blood tests which may not always capture the early stages of the disease. This is where \\nmachine learning comes in. We aim to devel op a machine learning model that can predict the risk of \\ndeveloping diabetes using available patient data. This data could include factors like Blood sugar level, \\nBody Mass Index (BMI), Age, Family history of diabetes, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol levels et c. By \\nanalyzing these factors, the model can identify individuals at high risk of developing diabetes.'),\n Document(metadata={'producer': 'www.ilovepdf.com', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2016', 'creationdate': '2024-03-29T08:21:20+00:00', 'author': 'ramdhan prajapat', 'moddate': '2024-03-29T08:21:20+00:00', 'source': '/kaggle/input/myreportpdf/AI_product_prototyping_project1_report_diabetes_prediction.pdf', 'total_pages': 12, 'page': 1, 'page_label': '2'}, page_content='3.

This capability is particularly well-suited to medical \\napplications, especially those that depe nd on complex proteomic and genomic measurements. As  a result, \\nmachine learning is frequently used in cancer diagnosis and detection. More recently machine learning has \\nbeen applied to cancer prognosis and prediction. This latter approach is particularly interesting as it is part \\nof a growing trend towards personalized, predictive medicine. In assembling this  review we conducted a \\nbroad survey of the different types of machine learning methods being used, the  types of data being \\nintegrated and the performance of these methods in cancer prediction and prognosis. \\n \\nThe conclusions were made based on the data available on the internet. \\nThe percentages were calculated roughly in a relative manner'),\n Document(metadata={'producer': 'www.ilovepdf.com', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2016', 'creationdate': '2024-03-29T08:21:20+00:00', 'author': 'ramdhan prajapat', 'moddate': '2024-03-29T08:21:20+00:00', 'source': '/kaggle/input/myreportpdf/AI_product_prototyping_project1_report_diabetes_prediction.pdf', 'total_pages': 12, 'page': 3, 'page_label': '4'}, page_content=\"5.2 Machine learning-based prediction of survival prognosis \\n \\nSurvival prediction after first diagnosis is crucial for both disease specialists and patients or their family \\nmembers. Firstly, as the survival prospects of diabetes patients significantly rely on the progression of the \\ndisease, accurately predicting the prognosis would be beneficial for estimating the severity of the condition \\nand the timing of disease progression. On the other hand, patients and their families can establish suitable \\ngoals based on precise survival predictions. Consequently, timely preventive measures and treatments can \\nbe initiated, and the risk of inappropriate treatment decisions, such as over-treatment or delayed palliative \\ncare, can be effectively mitigated. \\n5.3 Diabetes dataset: \\n \\nFeatures are computed from clinical measurements associated with diabetes diagnosis.
